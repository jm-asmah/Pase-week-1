        Astonishing Facts About Tigers
      </h1>
      <p>
        20 Facts You Probably Did not Know About Tigers. Tigers are often looked
        as being one of the most beautiful yet ferocious animals and perhaps
        this is a sole driving factor that makes them even more interesting
        creatures. But sadly, they have come to a verge of being categorized as
        endangered, thanks to the human sloppiness and prudence. As a wildlife
        lover with keen interest on large cats, I enjoy visiting wildlife
        sanctuaries but the question remains, how well do I or we know about
        this exotic animal? We are often clouded by many misconceptions with
        other large cat species, but hopefully, you will learn something about
        them through this blog where I have listed some facts about tigers.
        Spoiler alert - you would be knowing some of the facts already but what
        the hell! <br /><br />

                 <p>You probably knew this that Royal Bengal Tigers are the largest amongst other wild cats but did you also know that the male Tigers weigh up to 300 kilograms. Jezz! That is like weighing a group of six average human. All they have to do is sit on top of you licking their paws, you would be dead instantly.</p> <br>

                    Leaving aside Tigers enormous body size, just look at their front-hands/legs, if you have a pet Tiger and a brutal enemy, you might as well send them for a fist fight. Kidding, you cannot have a pet tiger, it illegal! It is said that one swipe from a Tigers front hand is enough to kill a person or an animal, or at least break the preys bones.

                <li>Tigers are nocturnal animals</li>

                <p>It is not necessarily true that all Tigers are nocturnal but yes, they do prefer engaging in most of their hunting activities at night. The reason behind this is that Tigers prefer avoiding human conflict during daylight and also patrol around their territory at night.</p>

                <h1>WHO KNEW? 10 AMAZING AND IMPORTANT LION FACTS</h1>
            <p>
                Lions are one of Africas most recognizable animals and for good reason: more than any other animal in the African wilderness, lions signify courage, strength and power. 
                The ancient Egyptians saw these traits in the wild lions of Africa and used them as symbols in their own cultureâ€”the legendary sphinx features the head of a human and the body of a lion, 
                for example.
                Here at Lion World Travel the lion is the center of our brand and the name for our particular lion is Lionel.
                In addition to the symbolizing strength and courage, he also embodies playfulness: take a close look at our logo and you will notice that Lionels tongue is lolling lazily out of his mouth.
                Read on for more amazing lion facts! <br><br>

                    <li>LIONS ARE SOCIAL</li>
                    <P>

                        Of all the big cat species in the world, lions are the most social. They live together in large groups known as <q>prides</q>. The size of a pride can range in size from 15 to 40 members. These prides include multiple adult males, a dozen or more related females and the <q>pride</q> cubs. In general, the more members a pride has, the stronger it is relative to rival prides. The prides females also prefer to have more males in the pride as this helps to ensure the survival of their cubs. <br><br>
                    </P>
                    <li>FEMALE LIONS DO MOST OF THE HUNTING, WHILE MALES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE PRIDE</li>

                    height="200px">
                    <p>
                        Male lions may get all of the attention with their majestic manes, but the females do the majority of the work when it comes to hunting. Anywhere from 85-90% of the hunting is done by the females in a given pride. The males, meanwhile, protect both the pride and the pride territory (which can extend up to 100 square miles) from rival prides and other predators. Even though females do the vast majority of the hunting, male lions usually get to eat first! <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <li>LIONS DO NOT NEED TO DRINK EVERYDAY, BUT THEY DO NEED TO EAT</li>
                    <img src="./img/29.jpg" alt="Lion" style="width: 250px;"

                    <p>
                        Lions can go up to four days without drinking water, but they need to eat everyday. Adult female lions need to eat about 11 pounds of meat each day, while adult males eat 16 pounds or more every day. And while lions primarily prey on large herbivores such as zebra, wildebeest and buffalo, they have been known to prey on smaller animals. <br><br>
